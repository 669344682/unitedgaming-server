# United Gaming Roleplay - Server

This repository contains the server resources for the United Gaming MTA RP server.  
I stumbled across these files on an old hard drive. I assume these files are from 2013, or at least somewhere around there.  

It's been 4-5 years since I screwed up everything, because I was a shitty person. 
Maybe I still am. I decided to upload these files for the sake of nostalgia.

There is no way you're going to be able to run anything from these files, because most of the functions are probably deprecated and removed by todays standards - but also, spaghetti code.
